Welcome to my personal blog! This is my first post, where I’ll introduce myself and share what you can expect from this space.

## About me
My name is Alex and I’m a **backend developer**. I currently have 3 years of experience in web application development.
My main **hobbies** are programming, reading books, and playing video games.

I work at **BBVA Technology**, where my main role is developing microservices with **Java**.

## What to expect from this blog?
In this blog I’ll share my experiences, knowledge, and projects related to web development, especially the ones I’m currently working on. I’ll talk about the challenges I face and the solutions I find.

Whenever I start a new project, I do it with the intention of learning something new, so I hope this blog reflects that continuous learning and also serves as documentation for my projects.

## Blog goals
- Share my experiences and learnings in web development.
- Document my projects and the challenges I face.
- Learn Astro and improve my frontend skills.

## Current projects
I’m working on two projects:

1. **Projeclyze**: A web application to manage tasks and document projects efficiently.
2. **Portfolio and blog**: This is the site where you’re reading this article, where I’ll share my projects and posts related to web development.

Both projects are under development and I hope to share more details about them in future posts.

Thanks for reading my first post. Soon I’ll share a post about **Projeclyze**.
See you in the next one!
