Hello everyone! In this post, I want to share with you the goals and the current development status of **Projeclyze**, a web application I’m working on.

## What is Projeclyze? 👋
Projeclyze is a web application designed to help developers and teams manage their projects efficiently.
The idea is to provide a platform where tasks can be documented and organized.

This application was born from the need to have a single place to centralize all the information, tasks, and documentation related to the projects I’m working on.

The plan is to start by developing a **self-hosted** web application, but in the future, I’d like to offer a **SaaS version** to make it easier for more people to use. The application will be **free and open source**.

## Projeclyze Goals 🎯
The main goals of Projeclyze are:
- **Task management**: Allow users to create, assign, and track the progress of tasks related to their projects.
- **Centralized documentation**: Provide a space to upload documentation in Markdown format and link it to projects and tasks.

## Technologies used 🛠️
For Projeclyze development, I’m using the following technologies:
- **Backend**: Golang
- **Frontend**: React
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## Current development status 🚧
Currently, Projeclyze is in an early stage of development. I’m finishing the backend, and once it’s completed, I’ll upload the code to GitHub and make the repository public.

The next step will be to start developing the frontend, where I’ll implement the core functionalities for **task management** and **documentation**.

My goal is to build an **MVP** as soon as possible to start testing the application, gather feedback, and iterate on it. I’ll also add a section for users to send feedback easily and anonymously.

## Next steps ➡️
- Finalize backend development
- Upload the code to GitHub and make the repository public
- Start frontend development
- Create a functional MVP to begin testing the application
- Gather feedback and improve the application

I hope to share more details about Projeclyze’s development in future posts. Thanks for reading, and see you in the next one!
